# Contributing to Computer Vision CNC Manufacturing Optimization Platform

Welcome to the Computer Vision CNC Manufacturing Optimization Platform! We appreciate your interest in contributing to this enterprise-grade industrial automation project. This guide will help you understand our development process, coding standards, and contribution requirements.

## üè≠ Manufacturing Domain Context

This project operates in the critical domain of industrial manufacturing where software reliability, safety, and compliance are paramount. All contributions must consider:

- **Safety-Critical Environment**: Code may control or monitor industrial equipment
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Must adhere to manufacturing standards (ISO 9001, IATF 16949, IEC 62443)
- **Industrial Integration**: Compatibility with existing CNC systems and protocols
- **Performance Requirements**: Sub-20ms latency and 99.9% uptime targets

## ü§ù Code of Conduct

### Professional Standards

- **Manufacturing Excellence**: Approach all contributions with the precision expected in industrial manufacturing
- **Safety First**: Always consider the safety implications of code changes
- **Collaborative Engineering**: Foster a culture of knowledge sharing and continuous improvement
- **Respect for Expertise**: Value domain knowledge in manufacturing, computer vision, and industrial automation

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Compromising safety or security standards
- Introducing code that violates manufacturing compliance requirements
- Bypassing established testing and validation procedures
- Sharing proprietary manufacturing processes or sensitive industrial data

## üèóÔ∏è Development Process

### 1. Issue Creation and Discussion

Before starting work:

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplication
2. **Create detailed issue** using appropriate template:
   - Bug Report (for defects)
   - Feature Request (for enhancements)
   - Security Vulnerability (for security issues)
   - Manufacturing Integration (for CNC manufacturer support)
   - Performance Issue (for latency/throughput problems)

3. **Discuss approach** with maintainers before implementation
4. **Get assignment** to avoid conflicting work

#### Type Hints

All functions must include type hints:

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple, Union
import numpy as np
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DetectionResult:
    """Computer vision detection result."""
    confidence: float
    bounding_box: Tuple[int, int, int, int]
    class_name: str
    timestamp: float

def detect_defects(
    image: np.ndarray,
    model: torch.nn.Module,
    threshold: float = 0.8
) -> List[DetectionResult]:
    """
    Detect manufacturing defects in industrial images.
    
    Args:
        image: Input image array (H, W, C)
        model: Trained defect detection model
        threshold: Confidence threshold for detections
        
    Returns:
        List of detection results
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If image format is invalid
        RuntimeError: If model inference fails
    """
    pass
```

#### Documentation Standards

**Google Style Docstrings:**

```python
def calculate_oee(
    availability: float,
    performance: float,
    quality: float
) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).
    
    OEE is a key performance metric in manufacturing that measures
    the effectiveness of manufacturing equipment.
    
    Args:
        availability: Equipment availability percentage (0.0-1.0)
        performance: Performance efficiency percentage (0.0-1.0)
        quality: Quality rate percentage (0.0-1.0)

        This calculation follows ISO 22400-2 manufacturing KPI standard.
    """
    return availability * performance * quality
```

import logging
from typing import Optional

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class ManufacturingError(Exception):
    """Base exception for manufacturing-related errors."""
    pass

class CNCConnectionError(ManufacturingError):
    """CNC machine connection error."""
    pass

def connect_to_cnc(host: str, port: int) -> Optional[CNCConnection]:
    """

    Args:
        host: CNC machine IP address
        port: Communication port
        
    Returns:
        CNC connection object or None if failed
        
    Raises:
        CNCConnectionError: If connection cannot be established
    """
    try:
        connection = CNCConnection(host, port)
        connection.connect()
        logger.info(f"Connected to CNC at {host}:{port}")
        return connection
    except ConnectionError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to connect to CNC {host}:{port}: {e}")
        raise CNCConnectionError(f"CNC connection failed: {e}") from e
```

### Security Standards

#### Secure Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**: All inputs must be validated and sanitized
2. **Authentication**: Use secure authentication mechanisms
3. **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control
4. **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
5. **Logging**: Log security events without exposing sensitive data

```python
import secrets
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class CNCCredentials(BaseModel):
    """Secure CNC machine credentials."""
    username: str
    password: str
    
    @validator('username')
    def validate_username(cls, v):
        if not v or len(v) < 3:
            raise ValueError('Username must be at least 3 characters')
        return v.strip()
    
    @validator('password')
    def validate_password(cls, v):
        if len(v) < 8:
            raise ValueError('Password must be at least 8 characters')
        return v

def encrypt_credentials(credentials: CNCCredentials) -> bytes:
    """Encrypt CNC credentials for secure storage."""
    key = Fernet.generate_key()
    cipher = Fernet(key)
    data = f"{credentials.username}:{credentials.password}"
    return cipher.encrypt(data.encode())
```

## üß™ Testing Standards
