        self.security = security_config
        self.connection_pool = self._initialize_secure_connections()
    
    def read_realtime_data(self):
        """
        Securely fetch real-time data from SCADA systems
        Implements retry logic and error handling
        """
        try:
            # Establish secure connection
            connection = self._get_secure_connection()
            
            # Fetch data with validation
            raw_data = connection.fetch_data()
            validated_data = self._validate_data_integrity(raw_data)
            
            # Transform to standard format
            return self._transform_to_standard_format(validated_data)
            
        except Exception as e:
            self._log_security_event(e)
